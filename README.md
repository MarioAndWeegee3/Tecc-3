# Tecc-3
A tech-based, kitchen-sink pack for Minecraft Fabric 1.18

## Building

First, install [packwiz](https://packwiz.infra.link/).

Then use the command `packwiz curseforge export` to build the pack zip. The exported zip should be in the root directory for the pack, and would be named something like `Tecc 3-<version>.zip`. You can then import that zip file into any launcher you want.
